# 🙋 Is it a free software?

Yes, it is open-source software, and you can use it following the terms of the license. However, please note that being open-source does not necessarily mean it's entirely free of charge. While most tools can be used for free, some may incur charges related to API usage and server costs.

Хотя мы стремимся предоставлять как можно больше услуг бесплатно, некоторые функции требуют оплаты. Это связано с тем, что мы несем расходы на серверы, обслуживание и другие эксплуатационные аспекты, необходимые для бесперебойной и надежной работы наших сервисов. Взимая плату за услуги премиум-класса, мы можем покрыть эти расходы и продолжать предлагать высококачественные и устойчивые услуги. Мы ценим ваше понимание и поддержку.

Подождите, на самом деле есть другой вариант вместо того, чтобы просто оплатить счет.

Как профессиональный программист, вы можете внести свой вклад в этот проект и создать запрос на включение для этого проекта, после чего вы сможете получить бесплатное премиум-членство на три месяца.

# ✉️ A Letter to CodeGen ToolBox Users

Greetings from the CodeGen ToolBox team.

In the midst of this cold winter, we are thrilled to announce that CodeGen ToolBox has released its entire source code and has been renamed to LafTools for a more concise and specific product name. From this point forward, our team will also be known as the LafTools Team.

Despite our software now being fully open source, we remain committed to serving our premium users as before. We are deeply grateful to those who have shown us their unreserved trust and generous support by upgrading to our premium account. Rest assured, your paid services will remain unaffected, and we are continually exploring ways to enhance this product.

Our decision to completely open our source code was driven by the following reasons::

- To conduct a security reviews
- To demonstrate the void of malicious logic or backdoors
- To welcome contributions from the community
- To build a strong reputation and earn trust.

We understand your concerns about potential hacking attempts to bypass the activation logic of the software. Indeed, we acknowledge this as a potential issue. However, we have realized that LafTools should thrive by selling services, not just software licenses.

We'd like to remind you below things:

- Download our software from the official Github repository or our official website.
- Report any security issues you detect.
- Do not hesitate to submit your proposals for UI, tools, development, or any other aspects.

Lastly, we would like to express our gratitude for your time in reading this section.

Thank you.
