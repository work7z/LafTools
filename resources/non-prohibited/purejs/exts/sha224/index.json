It is part of the SHA-2 family of hash functions, which also includes SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512. SHA-224 is designed to be more secure than its predecessor, SHA-1, which has been shown to be vulnerable to collision attacks. SHA-224 is widely used in digital signatures, message authentication codes, and other applications where data integrity is critical."]}}}
