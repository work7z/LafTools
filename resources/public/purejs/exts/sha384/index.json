      "gh9zA.sha384",
      "SHA-384 is a cryptographic hash function that takes an input and produces a 384-bit (48-byte) hash value. It is part of the SHA-2 family of hash functions, which also includes SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-512, SHA-512/224, and SHA-512/256. SHA-384 is designed to be more secure than its predecessor, SHA-1, which has been shown to be vulnerable to collision attacks. SHA-384 is widely used in digital signatures, message authentication codes, and other applications where data integrity is critical."
